# Island Perimeter

This project involves calculating the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid using Python. The solution follows specific guidelines and constraints, focusing on grid traversal, perimeter calculation, and proper coding practices.

## Description

The goal is to implement a function that calculates the perimeter of an island represented as a rectangular grid. The grid contains:
- `0`: Represents water.
- `1`: Represents land.

### Rules
- Each cell is square with a side length of 1.
- Cells are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
- The grid is completely surrounded by water.
- There is only one island, and there are no lakes (enclosed water cells).
