ALX - 0x01. Lockboxes

Overview
This project aims to display knowledge in Python threading and Lockboxes


The task solved was is to determine if a series of locked boxes can be opened starting from an initially unlocked box. Throughout this project, we also explore foundational concepts in Python threading, locks, and graph theory that help build a deeper understanding of the underlying logic and problem-solving techniques.

Background Knowledge
1. Graph Theory Basics
Before tackling the problem, understanding graph theory helped conceptualize how keys and boxes relate:

Graph Representation: Think of each box as a node and each key as a directed edge from one node (box) to another.
Traversal: We need to determine if all nodes (boxes) can be reached starting from the initial node (boxes[0]). This is similar to checking if all nodes are reachable from a starting point in a directed graph.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS): Using a stack to store keys and explore boxes is similar to DFS.

2. Threading and Locks in Python
While the canUnlockAll problem itself doesn’t require threading, learning about threads and locks was crucial for understanding coordination between concurrent tasks, which helps when thinking about how state (locked/unlocked) changes:
Threading Basics: Managing tasks in parallel using Python’s threading module.
Locks: Used to prevent race conditions. Understanding locks helped visualize how access to resources (like opening boxes) might need coordination.
join(): Allows one thread to wait for another to complete. Similar in concept to waiting until all boxes have been checked before deciding if they can all be unlocked.

3. Conceptual Ties Between Graphs and Locks
Using locks and the acquire()/release() methods gave insights into managing resources and state changes—concepts that are key when thinking about traversing through all boxes and unlocking them.
Understanding how threads block and wait is conceptually similar to how a box might “wait” to be unlocked by a key from another box.

Additional project requirements

Concepts Needed:
Lists and List Manipulation:

Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.

Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.

Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
